	    	<div class="column">
	    	<img src="./Pictures/govt icon.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/>
	    	<p>The Federal government (USDA) regulates low standards on breeders. They don't promote responsible breeding to ensure healthy puppies. For example, it's legal for licensed breeders to own 1,000 or more dogs, keep them in very small cages for their entire lives, and breed them as often as possible.

		 	<div class="column">
	    	<img src="./Pictures/inpector icon.jpg" width="300px" height="auto"/>
	    	<p> There are very few inspectors in each state to thoroughly inspect for hundreds – sometimes thousands – of licensed breeding facilities all around America. Often many don't get inspected properly. </p>

	     	<div class="column">
	    	<img src="./Pictures/profit.jpg" width ="300px" height="auto"/>
	    	<p> Pet companies see this as opportunities to make a profit. As a result, a vicious cycle of puppies bred in large numbers and not cared for. Maybe of these puppies develop health problem later on and gets abandoned </p>
